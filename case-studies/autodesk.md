## Struggling with Data Visibility and Manual Workflows

Paolo Serra, a Principal Implementation Consultant at Autodesk® Consulting, provides support to customers to enable data-centric workflows, and integrating systems with custom app development leveraging Autodesk® Platform Services. 

Paolo helps a wide variety of companies that need a better way to move data and manage their digital project delivery in a way that is easily visible for all stakeholders to see the progress. Up until now, many relied on legacy, disconnected workflows using spreadsheets or other 3rd party systems, disjointed from where the live project data is stored.


Customers most frequently needed help with: 

- **Document Management**: This feature helps construction teams organize, store, and share important documents (e.g., blueprints, contracts, plans, [3D designs and 2D drawings data](https://tutorials.autodesk.io/tutorials/simple-viewer/)) efficiently in a Common Data Environment.
- **RFI (Request for Information)**: RFIs are formal requests used during construction to clarify aspects of a project. Autodesk Construction Cloud® allows users to manage and track these RFIs within the platform. 

Paolo recently led a project to build an app to facilitate the exchange of information between design and construction and migrate Documents and RFIs between two different systems.  

He is a Python developer and was looking to build a production grade web app.

It normally requires multiple people to get an app up and there was a lack of resources available in the time frame we needed.
```

The solution had to be cloud based, to connect to existing systems and they only had 60 days to deliver it all. 


## Why Existing Solutions Fell Short for Autodesk® Needs

Paolo explored other Python web app frameworks but only Reflex met the key requirements of supporting Autodesk® certified React components and having an easy, logical interface.

Reflex gave us the freedom to create a product that could meet our business needs.
```

### From One Project to Four

Paolo and his team have now worked on three other initiatives  with Reflex: 

1. A content management service to entirely redesign how consulting services are delivered, from an in person experience to an online digital platform for consulting 

2. An information registry to enable tracking of digital delivery of artifacts 

3. An analysis dashboard which understands insights into what is happening in a company data, draws conclusions, and link to all the relevant Autodesk® services

Everything I was able to accomplish was because of the framework and unparalleled support and promptness of the Reflex team when I found an obstacle that was blocking me, investigating the issue and suggesting alternative approaches during their office hours and on their Discord channel.
