# UI Overview

Components are the building blocks for your app's user interface (UI). They are the visual elements that make up your app, like buttons, text, and images.

## Component Basics

Components are made up of children and props.

```md definition
# Children
* Text or other Reflex components nested inside a component.
* Passed as **positional arguments**.

# Props
* Attributes that affect the behavior and appearance of a component.
* Passed as **keyword arguments**.
```

Let's take a look at the `rx.text` component.

```python demo
rx.text('Hello World!', color='blue', font_size="1.5em")
```

Here `"Hello World!"` is the child text to display, while `color` and `font_size` are props that modify the appearance of the text.

```md alert success
Regular Python data types can be passed in as children to components.
This is useful for passing in text, numbers, and other simple data types.
```

## Another Example

Now let's take a look at a more complex component, which has other components nested inside it. The `rx.hstack` component is a container that arranges its children horizontally.


```python demo
rx.hstack(
    # Static 50% progress
    rx.chakra.circular_progress(
        rx.chakra.circular_progress_label("50", color="green"),
        value=50,
    ),
    # "Spinning" progress
    rx.chakra.circular_progress(
        rx.chakra.circular_progress_label("âˆž", color="rgb(107,99,246)"),
        is_indeterminate=True,
    ),
)
```

Some props are specific to a component. For example, the `value` prop of the `rx.chakra.circular_progress` component controls the progress bar's value.

Styling props like `color` are shared across many components.

```md alert info
# You can find all the props for a component by checking its documentation page in the [component library]({library.path}).
```

## Pages

Reflex apps are organized into pages. Pages link a specific URL route to a component.

You can create a page by defining a function that returns a component. By default, the function name will be used as the path, but you can also specify a path explicitly.

```python
def index():
    return rx.text('Root Page')


def about():
    return rx.text('About Page')


app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index, route="/")
app.add_page(about, route="/about")
```

In this example we add a page called `index` at the root route. 
If you `reflex run` the app, you will see the `index` page at `http://localhost:3000`.
Similarly, the `about` page will be available at `http://localhost:3000/about`.
