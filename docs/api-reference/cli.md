  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

## Run

The `reflex run` command runs the app in the current directory.

By default it runs your app in development mode.
This means that the app will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.
You can also run in production mode which will create an optimized build of your app.

You can configure the mode, as well as other options through flags.

```bash
$ reflex run --help
Usage: reflex run [OPTIONS]

  Run the app in the current directory.

Options:
  --env [dev|prod]                The environment to run the app in.
                                  [default: Env.DEV]
  --frontend-only                 Execute only frontend.
  --backend-only                  Execute only backend.
  --frontend-port TEXT            Specify a different frontend port.
                                  [default: 3000]
  --backend-port TEXT             Specify a different backend port.  [default:
                                  8000]
  --backend-host TEXT             Specify the backend host.  [default:
                                  0.0.0.0]
  --loglevel [debug|info|warning|error|critical]
                                  The log level to use.  [default:
                                  LogLevel.INFO]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

## Export

You can export your app's frontend and backend to zip files using the `reflex export` command.

The frontend is a compiled NextJS app, which can be deployed to a static hosting service like Github Pages or Vercel.
However this is just a static build, so you will need to deploy the backend separately.
See the self-hosting guide for more information.
