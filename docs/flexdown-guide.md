# Flexdown

Flexdown allows you to write interactive documentation with Python and Markdown.

It is a superset of [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), and uses [Reflex](https://reflex.dev) to add custom components in pure Python.

## Example

Flexdown lets you blend Markdown with Reflex elements.

````md
# Hello World

Write any **Markdown** you want.

```python eval
rx.alert(
    rx.alert_icon(),
    rx.alert_title("Mix in Reflex components!"),
)
```
````
```

# Getting Started
