An area chart combines the line chart and bar chart to show how one or more groupsâ€™ numeric values change over the progression of a second variable, typically that of time. An area chart is distinguished from a line chart by the addition of shading between lines and a baseline, like in a bar chart.

For an area chart we must define an `rx.area()` component that has a `data_key` which clearly states which variable in our data we are tracking. In this simple example we track temperature against time and therefore set the `rx.x_axis` to equal `day`.
