# Blockquote

```python demo
blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.")
```


## Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the blockquote. The prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacingâ€”as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.


```python demo
flex(
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="1"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="2"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="3"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="4"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="5"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="6"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="7"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="8"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", size="9"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```


## Weight

Use the `weight` prop to set the blockquote weight.

```python demo
flex(
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", weight="light"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", weight="regular"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", weight="medium"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", weight="bold"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```



## Color

Use the `color_scheme` prop to assign a specific color, ignoring the global theme.


```python demo
flex(
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", color_scheme="indigo"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", color_scheme="cyan"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", color_scheme="crimson"),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", color_scheme="orange"),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```

## High Contrast

Use the `high_contrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.


```python demo
flex(
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts."),
    blockquote("Perfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts.", high_contrast=True),
    direction="column",
    spacing="3",
)
```
