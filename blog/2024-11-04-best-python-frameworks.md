![Python is top languge in 2024](/blog/python-top-language-2024.png)

- In recent GitHub report -> Python ranked as the most popular language
The Python community is vibrant and has a lot of frameworks to choose from; so many options however can make it difficult to choose the right one.
We go over our the top Python data, AI and web app frameworks and walkthrough the advantages of each.

## Reflex--Frontend. Backend. Pure Python.

Reflex represents a shift in web development by enabling developers to build complete applications using only Python.
Reflex was built to seamlessly integrate your backend and frontend and provides over 60 built-in components that developers can extend--Reflex's UI components are React under the hood.

### Pros

- **Pure Python**: Reflex enables you to build both your frontend and backend in Python.
- **No boilerplate**: Reflex abstracts away connecting your frontend and backend.
- **Flexible and expressive**: Reflex has over 60 UI components built in, and supports React (bring your own components), Tailwind, and more.
- **Database management**: Reflex also has first class support for SQLite, Postgres, and MySQL.
- **Deployment**: Reflex apps can be deployed to the cloud with a single command (`reflex deploy`).

### Cons

- **Ecosystem**: Reflex is a newer framework, so it has a smaller ecosystem compared to more established alternatives, however with 20k stars on GitHub it's one of the fastest growing Python frameworks.
- **Breaking changes**: Reflex is still maturing and so the APIs are subject to change.

## FastAPI--high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production

FastAPI is a modern web framework that has become popular for building REST APIs.
Being built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, FastAPI is performant and easy to use and excels in scenarios requiring high performance and concurrent processing.

### Pros

- **Automatic documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) documentation for your API based on the Python type hints you provide, enhancing the developer experience.
- **Data validation**: FastAPI uses Pydantic for data validation, allowing developers to easily validate request and response data with high performance.
- **Type hints**: FastAPI utilizes Python type hints, improving code quality and simplifying API interactions.
- **Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python web frameworks available, often on par with Node.js and Go.
- **Dependency injection**: FastAPI features a built-in dependency injection system, facilitating component management.

### Cons

- **JavaScript dependency**: FastAPI requires a separate frontend framework
- **Onboarding**: Not as accessible for folks who have not deployed web apps before. FastAPI is great for teams and organizations building services but for an individual just trying to build a side project it may be more difficult to get started.

Reflex builds on top of FastAPI by adding a frontend layer, and abstracting away the boilerplate of connecting your backend and frontend--dramatically simplifying the development of full stack apps.
Deployed Reflex apps get transpiled into FastAPI backend, and React frontend.

## Django--the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines

Django is a mature (batteries included) framework that has a large ecosystem with plugins for additional functionality like authentication, admin interfaces, a content management system, and more.
As one of the oldest Python frameworks, Django not only has a large community and ecosystem, but has also been battle tested by over many years.

### Pros

- **Mature**: Django has been around for a long time, and has a large ecosystem and community.
- **Admin interface**: Django has a built in admin interface for managing content.
- **ORM**: Django has a built in database ORM for interacting with your database.
- **Plugin system**: Django has a plugin system for adding additional functionality.

### Cons

- **Performance**: Django is not as performant as FastAPI--which was designed for performance and with async in mind from the beginning (ASSGI).
- **JavaScript dependency**: Django requires a separate frontend framework; there's an HTML templating system, but it's not as powerful as a React.
- **Monolithic**: Django is a monolithic framework, which can make it difficult to maintain and scale large applications.
- **Learning Curve**: Django has a steep learning curve, especially for those unfamiliar with its settings and file structure.

## Flask--the micro framework for building web apps

Flask is a lightweight (micro) web framework that is easy to get started with and is a good choice for building microservices.

### Pros

- **Lightweight**: Flask is a lightweight framework that is easy to get started with.
- **Flexible**: Flask has a minimalistic approach to web development, providing a solid foundation on which developers can build.

### Cons

- **Synchronous**: Flask is synchronous by default, which can be a bottleneck in performance-critical applications.
- **Jinja templating**: Web apps built with Flask are typically built using Jinja templating, which is not as powerful as React.
- **Documentation**: Compared to FastAPI, Flask requires using additional libraries to build documentation.

## Streamlit--a faster way to build and share data apps.

Streamlit has gained considerable traction among data scientists for its ability to convert data scripts into interactive web applications quickly with minimal coding.
Streamlit is good for building an app to test a model, or a dashboard to visualize data.
However its not suited for building long running applications that are meant to be interactive or ones with complex user interfaces.

### Pros

- **Quick prototyping**: Streamlit excels at quickly converting data scripts into small web applications.
- **Data visualization**: Streamlit has built in components for common data visualization tasks.
- **App gallery**: Streamlit has a large app gallery with examples of how to build common applications.

### Cons

- **Limited domain**: Streamlit is best for building web apps that are used to visualize data.
- **Limited UI components**: Streamlit has a limited set of UI components compared to Reflex.
- **Limited interactivity**: Streamlit is not suited for building long running applications that are meant to be interactive or ones with complex user interfaces.

## Gradio--build and share delightful machine learning apps

Gradio is an open source Python library that creates user-friendly, web-based interfaces for machine learning models.
It integrates well with popular ML libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face, making it a go-to choice for prototyping and sharing models.

Pros:
- **Easy deployment**: Gradio apps can quickly be deployed to Hugging Face spaces.
- **ML integration**: Gradio integrates well with popular ML libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face.

Cons:
- **Limited domain**: Gradio is best for experimenting with machine learning models, not for building a prodction grade or complex web applications.
- **Graduation risk**: Large Gradio projects tend to require custom JavaScript code to build complex user interfaces.

## Dash--data apps & dashboards for Python

Dash is a framework for building analytical web apps. It's built on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js.
Dash applications are structured into two main components: layout and interactivity.
The layout defines the visual structure using HTML and React components, while interactivity is managed through callbacks that respond to user inputs.

### Pros

- **Data components**: Dash has an extensive library of data components.
- **Multiple languages**: Dash supports Python, R, and Julia.
- **Academic community**: Dash is one of the earliest Python data visualization frameworks and subsequently has a strong academic community.

### Cons

- **Callbacks**: Dash uses callbacks to manage interactivity, large apps become difficult to manage.
- **Cloud deployment**: Plotly's hosting service is primarily for enterprise, although
cannot be easily deployed can be deployed with containers, making them easy to manage and scale.
